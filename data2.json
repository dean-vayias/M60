When the data changes, either due to an external event or because of an action taken by the user, SwiftUI automatically updates the affected parts of the interface. As a result, the framework automatically performs most of the work traditionally done by view controllers.</p><p>The framework provides tools, like state variables and bindings, for connecting your app's data to the user interface. These tools help you maintain a single source of truth for every piece of data in your app, in part by reducing the amount of glue logic you write.</p>"

				"explanation": "<p>SwiftUI implements many data management types, like State and Binding, as Swift property wrappers. Apply a property wrapper by adding an attribute with the wrapper's name to a property's declaration. The property gains the behavior specified by the wrapper. The state and data flow property wrappers in SwiftUI watch for changes in your data, and automatically update affected views as needed. When you refer directly to the property in your code, you access the wrapped value. Alternatively, you can access a property wrapper's projected value by prefixing the property name with the dollar sign ($). SwiftUI state and data flow property wrappers always project a Binding, which is a two-way connection to the wrapped value, allowing another view to access and mutate a single source of truth.</p>"
